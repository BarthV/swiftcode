# TODO

### Core features
* Add multiplayer keystroke propagation
* Add multiplayer end screen
* Anonymous usage
* Spam protection in login process
* Modify home screen to provide overview of game
* Flag button to allow users to indicate incorrect highlighting of code
* Add automated tests to compare server-side typeable-detection with client-side typeable-to-DOM matching algorithm

### Bugs
* Game start time is based on client-side clock, which could be slightly off by a couple of seconds. Find a better way to synchronize the game start

### Possible future features
* Auto-scrolling in-game
* Learning mode? (collaborate with 'Learn X in Y' project?)
* Profile page, where user can see stats, tweak settings
* In-game dashboard, showing opponent names / progress
* Names / passwords / invitation-only option for game rooms
* Training mode? ("beat your own time")
* Dynamic favicon update in lobby page, when people login / logout
